## About the projetc

This is a project to have a more freedom and easy way to share and manage the media content in the internet.

The ideia is not to leave the other medias, you can do it if you want but one of the goals is have something like a global management of all your sources of media, like videos in youtube and lives in twitch, so you can get the better of other platforms.

The cms will have a option to set the source of your content, that yout can define of where the videos will came, the ideia is have 3 options:

- Use your own host service as a source
- Use some external app like youtube, twitch
- Use both of them

"If works" this will get a lot of benefits like:

- Infinite uploads space of google
- No need to migrate your videos from other platfort.
- Easy to test using with your current content in other platforms
- You can use your host instace to upload video that do not agree with polics of some other platform, but still is in the same place.
