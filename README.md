## About the project

This is a project to have a more freedom and easy way to share and manage media content in the internet.

The ideia is not to leave the others, you can do it if you want but one of the goals is have a global management of all sources of media that you can have, like videos that came from youtube and lives that came from twitch.

In the cms will be possible to set the source of your content, that yout can define of where the site will get the videos, so you can:

- Use your own host service as a source of videos
- Use some external app like youtube, twitch
- Use both of them

"If works" this will get a lot of benefits like:

- Infinite uploads space of google
- No need to migrate your videos from other platfort.
- Easy to test using with your current content in other platforms
- You can use your host instace to upload videos that do not agree with politics of the platform like videos not family-friendly, but still the users can see in the same place.
